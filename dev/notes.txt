Issues to resolve
1. Fix orders that have multiple OWN SHIRTS
2. From app launch, finish one order; the order object isn't completely reset (or maybe the orders array from customers) - FIXED
3. Get size from step one - FIXED
4. Title bar with home button - FIXED
5. Modal after hitting home button - LOW PRIORITY
6. Floating button on bottom right with price
7. Have Order.jsx track state of selected size in order to have just one add to cart button after at a time - LOW PRIORITY
8. Fix gallery bug - selecting one of the pictures in the preview portion closes modal
9. Can't add own shirt
10. Add close icon to gallery
11. Add CBN logo


Pretty much done with this stuff except for styling
1. Add code to see image gallery when clicking on image - DONE 6/16/18
2. Add "Brought my own shirt" option (and think of a good name) - DONE 6/16/18
3. Add code to launch camera when chosen - DONE 6/17/18; a-b done on 6/19/18
  a. Take picture
  b. Show pic
4. Add checkout button to summary
5. Create form component for user info
  a. name (required)
  b. phone number
  c. delivery? (yes or no)
    i. address appears if yes
  one of the following required
  d. FB
  e. Instagram
  f. Twitter
  g. Other (ex: Hotel room number, Meeting day/time)
6. Firebase - Figure out how to save all this data so it can be accessed
from any device
7. Update design - look at the images saved on my google images search (on my phone)
8. Add pictures
  a. For the shirts, have her take pictures of same design, but diff colors

Other Ideas
-Find a way to accept payment
-If we can't accept payment, add a question to the form that says Paid? with
two buttons (yes and no). If they choose yes, ask for pin (which Deri or I will
put in to confirm they paid).
